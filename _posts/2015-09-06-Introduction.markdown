Hey people,

And this is it, my 3rd attempt to create a blog. But now I got better motivations.

Let me introduce myself and the reasons to create this blog. My name is Diego, currently I'm living in London (UK) but I'm from Brazil, Sao Paulo precisely. I'm a C# developer working for Ve Interactive. I've already working in the IT area for a while, but about 3,5 years as a C# developer. I've already worked with Cobol (cobol, yes :( ), C/C++, and Linux systems. I'm a great fan of Linux, although I don't use any \*nix system nowadays :(

About the reasons to create the blog, I've been thinking about how to share some interesting things that I've been learning during the day (in/outside of work), and talking with a friend I decided to create it. Furthermore, another friend and I made a bet about who would post more good-quality articles.

You can find more information in the about page, as well as my contact.

That's all for now!
