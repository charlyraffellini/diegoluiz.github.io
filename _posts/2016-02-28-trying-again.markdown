And again, I failed writing this blog. I keep telling me I need to do that, but I keep postponing everything relate to it. But again I'm trying again! This weekend I installed Linux in my old laptop, started playing .net Core, came back to play with docker and helped my girlfriend with her studied in python. Ah! Apart from that, I bought more ram memory and a msata ssd which I will try to install next week, it's not a simple assembly, I need to remove the motherboard because the msata plug is under it :( Well,summarising in links: [http://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/ct250mx200ssd3](http://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/ct250mx200ssd3) [http://www.corsair.com/en-gb/vengeance-16gb-dual-channel-ddr3-memory-kit-cmz16gx3m4a1600c9](http://www.corsair.com/en-gb/vengeance-16gb-dual-channel-ddr3-memory-kit-cmz16gx3m4a1600c9) [https://linuxmint.com/rel_rosa_mate_whatsnew.php](https://linuxmint.com/rel_rosa_mate_whatsnew.php) with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [QuickTile](http://ssokolow.com/quicktile/) [](https://linuxmint.com/rel_rosa_mate_whatsnew.php) [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/) [http://dotnet.github.io/](http://dotnet.github.io/) [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/) And I started using Visual Studio Code as well, it's amazing!
