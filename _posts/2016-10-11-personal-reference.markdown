## Talks

*   [The first part sucks, but after the half is really good!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bB_fVDlvhc)

## Articles

*   [Great article about procrastination](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html). Probably there will be many links from [WBW](http://waitbutwhy.com/), I love this site! ([Part 2 is here](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html)). Many **really** nice articles which made me think a lot about life ([1](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html), [2](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html), [3](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/08/putting-time-in-perspective.html), [4](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)), how [people behave](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html), [science](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/03/why-is-my-laptop-on.html), and technology ([1](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), [2](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html)).
